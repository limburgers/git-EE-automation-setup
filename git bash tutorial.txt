`git add .` or `git add filename.py`

`git commit -m "short message"` or `git commit` and then edit in np++

`git push origin main` or `git push origin branchname`



in bash use ...

`cd` foldername to got to a folder

`cd ..` to go up one folder level

`ls` to list contents



downloading git bash...

instead of doing cd and other commands,

go into properties and change opening directory to "repos" folder (create one in c:users folder)



pulling from github into vscode... 
do git clone [github url] --branch [branch name]
after it finishes uploading into vscode, open the file that the clone is located in

(dont need to clone when opening a file again, just open file because it saves automatically)
  
 When committing a project, it is essentially the same as clicking "save as' with more benefits.
 Committing updates your local save file and makes it "ahead" of the github file (since it has more changes)
 When you git push, this is what updates the github file to your local file (github is basically a backup saver)
 - Opening a local file is basically just opening a saved file; you don't need to clone/pull each time.
 
  

- when using vscode, always use git bash inside of vscode, NOT the application
